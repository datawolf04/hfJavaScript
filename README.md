# Head First Javascript Programming

This is the repository for my code going through the book [_Head First Javascript_ by Eric Freedman and Elizabeth Robson](https://www.amazon.com/Head-First-JavaScript-Programming-Learners/dp/1098147944/).  I'll organize my work by chapter in the book. I'll note that oftentimes the goal is to make something semi-useful, so they start simple and build functionality as chapters progress.

## Chapter 1
Mostly intro stuff. Interacting with the `console.log` and using the `alert` function.

## Chapter 2
Basic battleship game. It is purely text based, and has a major logical flaw (repeated hits to the same location increment the total hits)

## Chapter 3
Beginning functions.
