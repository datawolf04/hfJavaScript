# Head First Javascript Programming

This is the repository for my code going through the book [_Head First Javascript_ by Eric Freedman and Elizabeth Robson](https://www.amazon.com/Head-First-JavaScript-Programming-Learners/dp/1098147944/).  I'll organize my work by chapter in the book. I'll note that oftentimes the goal is to make something semi-useful, so they start simple and build functionality as chapters progress.
